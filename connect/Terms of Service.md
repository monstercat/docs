## SECTION 2 - CONDITIONS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE (AKA “GOLD” OR “MONSTERCAT GOLD”)

### A) OVERVIEW
The “Subscription Service” (aka “Gold” or “Monstercat Gold”) is an online music catalogue service, by which we make available Monstercat music in the form of digital music files (the "Subscription Music") to subscribers to the Subscription Service (each, a “Subscriber”, and collectively, “Subscribers”) solely for the purpose of synchronizing such Subscription Music in audiovisual productions solely for exhibition on YouTube and/or Twitch channels owned and/or controlled by Subscribers for non-commercial purposes (the “Permitted Use”), while maintaining the right to earn royalty free advertising revenue from such channels (“Claim Free”), so long as such person is a Subscriber or as otherwise expressly described herein.  Upon a Termination Event (as defined below), the Claim Free use of Subscription Music shall be governed in accordance with Section E (Termination) below. Each Subscriber expressly acknowledges and agrees to not make use of any Subscription Music for any prohibited or commercial purposes and/or in connection with any sponsorship (including sponsored content), merchandising, advertisements or commercial tie-ins whatsoever, including without limitation: (a) in connection with the promotion, sponsorship and/or advertising of a product or service; (b) synchronizing the Subscription Music with so-called 'visualization' or static imagery, or with no discernable (or blank) video content; (c) making any use of the Subscription Music other than in connection with a Subscriber’s owned and/or controlled Twitch and/or YouTube channels; (d) making any so-called “bass boosted” or “nightcore” versions of Subscription Music (or anything that is similar or analogous in Monstercat’s sole and absolute discretion); (e) looping of any Subscription Music (i.e. 1 hour, 10 hour, etc.); (f) providing file sharing links to any Subscription Music; (g) using any Monstercat word or design trademarks as a Subscriber’s channel name or icon; and/or (h) uploading, streaming or otherwise making the Subscription Music available on any platform other than YouTube or Twitch. For the purposes of these Terms, we deem a Subscriber’s earning of advertising revenue from their YouTube and/or Twitch channel “non-commercial”.

### B) COMMERCIAL LICENSING

The Subscription Service is for the use of Subscription Music for non-commercial purposes only.  If you would like to use any Monstercat music for commercial purposes, please visit [https://www.monstercat.com/sync](/sync) or email [licensing@monstercat.com](mailto:licensing@monstercat.com). Monstercat is committed to licensing our music on competitive terms on par with music industry standards and we review and respond to all licensing inquires as soon as possible.

### C) ACCESS

Subscribers shall access Monstercat Gold from Monstercat’s website or via Streamlabs OBS live streaming software.  The Subscription Service is solely available for entities and persons that have registered and created an account, who have the ability to enter into a binding contract (i.e. are the age of majority in their state, province and/or country of residence, not personally bankrupt, etc.), and who pay the prescribed fee to access and use the Subscription Service (the “Fee”).  The Fee is stated in United States Dollars.

### D) MANAGEMENT

Monstercat reserves the right to amend the Subscription Music, including excluding certain Monstercat music from same, at all times without notice to Subscribers.  Each Subscriber accepts that the Subscription Music that is currently available might not be available at a later date.  Certain Monstercat music may not be made available as part of the Subscription Service due to licensing restrictions.  Monstercat strives to provide Subscribers with an extensive high-quality catalog of Subscription Music.

Monstercat reserves the right to manage Monstercat Gold in a manner that it believes, in its sole and absolute discretion, best benefits its users and best enables Monstercat to maintain the Subscription Service, including the right to unilaterally change the Fee and Subscription Music at any time.  Each Subscriber hereby gives Monstercat the express consent and permission to be contacted via email by Monstercat in respect of material changes to Monstercat Gold, including without limitation, in respect of: (a) changes to the Fee; (b) changes to the core functionality of the Subscription Service; (c) updates to Fee payment features and/or functionality; (d) updates to the Terms of Service applicable to the Subscription Service; (e) updates to YouTube and Twitch so-called ‘content ID’ programs that materially affect the Subscription Service; and (f) any other changes Monstercat deems are materially necessary to contact Subscribers about via email.  For greater clarity, Monstercat will not email Subscribers for marketing purposes, unless they have expressly consented to receiving such marketing communications (i.e. opted in).

Monstercat reserves the right to change or discontinue any portion or all of the Subscription Service, or to terminate or suspend the account of any person, that, in Monstercat's sole and absolute discretion, uses the Subscription Service in a manner that is not consistent with the Permitted Use.

### E) TERMINATION

In the event that: (a) a Subscriber ceases to be a Subscriber; (b) the Subscription Service is discontinued; (c) a Subscriber’s account is suspended or terminated; (d) the limited license granted to a Subscriber hereunder is revoked or otherwise terminated for any reason; or (e) any similar or analogous situation (each, a “Termination Event”), each Subscriber and former Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that upon a Termination Event, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Monstercat in law or equity, Monstercat shall have the right to cease such Subscriber’s continued use of the Subscription Music on a Claim Free basis and Monstercat shall be entitled, without limitation, to collect royalties from YouTube and/or Twitch in connection with such former Subscriber’s continued use of any such Subscription Music.  Solely in respect of audiovisual productions containing Subscription Music created while a former Subscriber was a Subscriber, Monstercat retains the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to deem a former Subscriber’s continued use of Subscription Music ‘promotional’ and may permit a former Subscriber to continue using the Subscription Music on a Claim Free basis, so long as such former Subscriber adheres to all of Monstercat’s prescribed Subscription Music crediting obligations.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Monstercat retains the right to revoke a former Subscriber’s ‘promotional’ use rights at any time in its sole and absolute discretion.

A Subscriber’s access to the Subscription Service will continue until a Termination Event.  To use the Subscription Service, a Subscriber must provide us with one or more Payment Methods.  “Payment Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated and determined from time to time in Monstercat’s sole and absolute discretion, and which may include payment through a Subscriber’s account with a third party. Unless a Subscriber cancels their membership before their next billing date, they authorize us to charge the Fee for the next billing cycle to their Payment Method.
A Subscriber may cancel their subscription to the Subscription Service at any time, and such Subscriber will continue to have access to the Subscription Service through the end of their billing period. To the extent permitted by applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods. 

### F) FEES & PAYMENT

The Fee for the Subscription Service and any other charges a Subscriber may incur in connection with their use of the Subscription Service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to the Subscriber’s Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the “Manage Subscriptions” page in a Subscriber’s account.  The length of a Subscriber’s billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that the Subscriber chooses when signing up for the Subscription Service.  In some cases, a Subscriber’s payment date may change, for example if the Subscriber’s Payment Method has not successfully settled, when a Subscriber changes their subscription plan or if the Subscriber’s paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.  We may authorize a Subscriber’s Payment Method in anticipation of membership or Subscription Service-related charges through various methods.

Each Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Monstercat, and is licensors, retain all right, title and interest in and to all data and information (excluding information and data that Subscribers provide) content and materials provided on or through the Subscription Service (including, without limitation, the musical compositions, audiovisual works, editorial and contextual information, text, images, photographs, videos, graphics, page headers, the selection and arrangement of elements displayed on or through the Subscription Service, the compilation of all content and materials on the Subscription Service, and the business process, procedures, methods and techniques used in the Subscription Service) and all associated copyright rights, trademark rights, trade secret rights and other intellectual property and proprietary rights recognized anywhere in the world (each as may be applicable). All rights are expressly reserved.
We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”) for the Subscription Service. Offer eligibility is determined by us in our sole and absolute discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer in the event that we determine you are not eligible, or in our sole and absolute discretion.

### G) LIMITED LICENSE

Monstercat grants Subscribers a limited, non-exclusive and non-assignable license to access and use the Subscription Service for the purpose of synchronizing selections from the catalogue of Subscription Music in timed relation with videos created by such Subscriber and to cause or authorize the exhibition of such videos solely by means of YouTube and/or Twitch channels owned and/or controlled by such Subscriber, on a non-commercial basis, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service and not for redistribution of any kind.  The foregoing license does not provide Subscribers the right to remix, substantially edit, or modify any of the Subscription Music.  Monstercat may make certain software and/or services available to you through a Subscriber’s use of the Subscription Service. Such software and/or services (as applicable) are deemed to be licensed to each Subscriber by Monstercat under a non-exclusive, non-assignable license for the Subscriber’s non-commercial use (as detailed herein), and each Subscriber’s use of such software and/or services is subject to these Terms of Service.

The owners of the Subscription Music made available through the Subscription Service are intended third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service and will have the right to enforce these Terms of Service against Subscribers (whether or not they have ceased to be a Subscriber) and invoke all rights hereunder including limitations of liability. Monstercat, as a reseller to Subscribers, does not accept order for music dealers, exporters, wholesalers or any other customers who intend to resell. The delivery of a product or content does not transfer to a Subscriber any commercial or promotional use rights in the product or content except as expressly contemplated herein.
